Setting Up Prefix
------------------
So the first thing after adding Crichub to your server you would like to do is check the prefix. Default prefix for Crichub is ``,`` and you can access it by mentioning it.
You can check the correct prefix by:
.. code-block:: console
  @CricHub#9872 prefix 

You can change the current prefix by:
.. code-block:: console
  @CricHub#9872 prefix .
